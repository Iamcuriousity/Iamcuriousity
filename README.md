I specialize in using data science and statistical modeling to investigate complex, real-world challenges at the intersection of climate change, public health, and food systems. My core expertise lies in:
Integrating geospatial data (rainfall, NDVI) with large-scale household survey datasets like NFHS/DHS
Applying causal inference methods, including weighted logistic regression, interaction and mediation models
Building reproducible pipelines in Python and R for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
Developing district- and region-level maps using GeoPandas, QGIS, and satellite raster data
Translating evidence into policy-ready briefs, dashboards, and open-source tools for decision-makers
Iâ€™ve applied these skills in projects hosted by J-PAL South Asia and International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics
